				<span>My far cry, though no one should echo,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though no one to listen should stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall dare with my burden the darkness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I shall not retreat from this land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I'm hurled 'neath the feet of the millions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who struggle their places to keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea-nymphs still bathe with my Fancy</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though I'm crushed, cast away and forgotten,—</span>

				<span class="i1">Though I'm buried in the dust of their cars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can see through their madness above me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I can feel the quick pulse of the stars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though my head be the foot-stool of tyrants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though my back be a step to their throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I still dwell with the kings of Orion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I walk with the sun-queen alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though the fire of my youth should consume me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though my body a brimstone should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can draw on the clouds for their water</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And behold! I've of water a sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though roofless, and friendless, and hopeless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loveless, and godless I stand,</span>

				<span>My soul and I, upon the peak</span>

				<span class="i1">Of Sanneen grim and grey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat musing in the twilight of</span>

				<span>"Great Saturn and the Moon are gone</span>

				<br/>
				<span>I, too, shall sail above this peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And signal yonder groves of pine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behold the melancholy sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of this forgotten land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this side are the valleys bleak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this, the desert sand."</span>

				<span>"O, think not of departing,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>I'll find the magic wings; and there</span>

				<span class="i1">Still hangs a friendly sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let us above these pines, and clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scents awhile yet dwell;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where wouldst thou go, if thou wert now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sigh a last farewell?"</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou seest the busy elements</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dissolving one by one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The souls that are acquitted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the all-absorbing sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let's sing the song of darkness then;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy prison is the Whole;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What canst thou do, where wilt thou go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What wilt thou be, my Soul?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the air that weighs</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The air in savage lust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the clouds that block</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The smoke's way to a star;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor linger in the guilty tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of clouds before the bar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the rain that taunts</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The all-devouring sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Itself destroying many a nest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In bush and rock and tree.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the thunder's tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spell-binding all the spheres;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor wouldst thou be the lightning blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That stabs and disappears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the dew that falls</span>

				<span class="i1">Set free from yonder clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to melt beneath the feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of surging human crowds."</span>

				<span>And worshipped with a piety blind!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long have I been seeking Rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the East and in the West!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here and there and everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have I seen her shadow fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the shadow seems to fade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the flowers of yonder glade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my lone retreat I sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her, but dreams against me fought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my nights for her I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with sleep she stays away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Foolish is thine effort, vain—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fruitless, hopeless is thy pain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the march of Motion keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy walk and in thy sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond thy finite power it lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To chain the coursers of the skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even nomads and cells minute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worlds of unrest constitute.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rest is no where to be found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each to all in suffering bound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no power can deliver thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mortal, from activity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy life as in thy death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy heart as in thy breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the earth as in the skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Restless Motion never dies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always raging, always spinning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Endless and without beginning.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Death, like me, is seeking Rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the seas are in her quest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ah, poor souls, she is beyond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our grasp; we must go on and on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No, nor even the grave is free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the laws that shackle me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New life from his worms takes wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his face fresh blossoms spring.</span>

				<span>Over the White Way's flood of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over its sea of fiery flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arose the voice of the ancient Night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the youthful Towers:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"O Night of nations passed," the Towers said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"One day stood high your monuments, but now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your highest pyramid must lift its head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see the lights that crown our City's brow."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"But man," replied the Night, "shall crown the stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With flowers of thought divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And write his name upon a monument</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greater than yours and mine."</span>

				<span>The deed is done. O Kings: the blood is shed;</span>

				<span>But she, the mother eternal of the dead,</span>

				<span>Her sack of Horror's harvest to refill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lo, into the untilled world she cast,</span>

				<span>With a million hands, the black seeds of her will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in the bone-strewn waste I saw a snail</span>

				<span>The nations bear when their sinews run out,</span>
				<br/>

				<span>To praise the air.</span>

				<span>The Cataclysm, passing to her goal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned inside out the pockets of the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not sparing even the altar of the soul,</span>

				<span>Which at the cradle of the soul she hurled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when at last she fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the sill of hell.</span>

				<span>I saw in her incalculable toll</span>

				<span>I walked along the countryside</span>

				<span>At eventide,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>The road was fair</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The voice of Doom;</span>

				<span>And, rifling the bejewelled gods, she drops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The veil of splendor from her howdah’s tops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rocks in state from Karnak to Cheops</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tramp the dust of Pharoah’s pride, to smite the phantom of his tomb.</span>

			<p>
				<span>But mocking Khamsin, when her mood is spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lulls the morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In luscious breezes swooning with the scent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of love reborn;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carressing winds! the tree senescent grows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In you as young as fruitful, and the rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the bistre lips of Ramesis blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whispering of things immortal to the wandering seed and the reed forlorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She passes in phantasmagoric waves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over shifting dunes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through shattered orbs, beyond the barren caves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of mouldering moons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the antique youth the Sun, as young to-day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when the cricket first essayed her lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the flood of Nilus makes his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with him weaves for Egypt wondrous summer garlands and galloons.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>And lo, the Khamsin of the world, in flames</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of crimson hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clouds of vitriolic dust, proclaims</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The era new;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But through the storm a spirit wings his flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the phosphorescent gulfs of night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this, upon the rising sun, doth write:—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God liveth, yea, God liveth still and man shall nothing rue.</span>

				<span>Of night their shadows, dew-drenched, iris-scented.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Garlanding the messengers of morning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the coming of the well-loved stranger.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, the Star of Love, the Light supernal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before which bowed the world in adoration.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is re-appearing in the Orient heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thy sake, for thee, O my Belovéd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, without thee, neither song nor flower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor star nor temple of antique Lebanus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has aught compelling of the Soul’s devotion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with thee, the caves, the naked ridges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The very rocks betoken the divine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span class="i1">O my Love, how long wilt hither tarry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Weaving gossamer of day and night?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sad Lebanus, O my Love, is calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Yea, and waiting in his House of Light.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Pagan</h2>
			<p>
				<span>I walked into her Temple, as of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My Tyrian sires, allured by cryptic signs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sudden as I entered closed the door</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the hope that mortal love resigns</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before her ancient, myrtle-bowered shrines.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I sorrowed not; though every lamp I lit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flamed up in speech articulate and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beware, O foolish Worshipper! ’t is writ:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who craves a gift shall give his soul instead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lights a lamp is cursed of the dead.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I did not heed; I passed from shrine to shrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filling the lamps with oil, the Fane with light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when I approached, O One Eternal, thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I heard the terror of her tongue, and Night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was creeping on her brow of malachite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I did not stop, although the votive oil</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I poured into thine urn to water turned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the Dawn her enchantments came to foil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The secret of thy clemency I learned—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again the oil upon thine altar burned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then suddenly the Temple shook and swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the shrines, except thine, disappeared;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even so her heart, by knowledge undismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Love’s one altar with thy hand upreared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Love’s one God is evermore endeared.</span>
