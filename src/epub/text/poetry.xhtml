			<h2 epub:type="title">Ever to Be</h2>
			<p>
				<span>My far cry, though no one should echo,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though no one to listen should stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall dare with my burden the darkness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I shall not retreat from this land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I'm hurled 'neath the feet of the millions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who struggle their places to keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea-nymphs still bathe with my Fancy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the Dryads still sweeten my sleep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though I'm crushed, cast away and forgotten,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I'm buried in the dust of their cars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can see through their madness above me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I can feel the quick pulse of the stars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though my head be the foot-stool of tyrants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though my back be a step to their throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I still dwell with the kings of Orion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I walk with the sun-queen alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though the fire of my youth should consume me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though my body a brimstone should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can draw on the clouds for their water</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And behold! I've of water a sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though roofless, and friendless, and hopeless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loveless, and godless I stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves of my Life shall continue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To murmur and laugh on the Strand.</span>
