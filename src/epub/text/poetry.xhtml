				<span>My far cry, though no one should echo,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though no one to listen should stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall dare with my burden the darkness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I shall not retreat from this land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I'm hurled 'neath the feet of the millions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who struggle their places to keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea-nymphs still bathe with my Fancy</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though I'm crushed, cast away and forgotten,—</span>

				<span class="i1">Though I'm buried in the dust of their cars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can see through their madness above me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I can feel the quick pulse of the stars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though my head be the foot-stool of tyrants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though my back be a step to their throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I still dwell with the kings of Orion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I walk with the sun-queen alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though the fire of my youth should consume me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though my body a brimstone should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can draw on the clouds for their water</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And behold! I've of water a sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though roofless, and friendless, and hopeless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loveless, and godless I stand,</span>

				<span>My soul and I, upon the peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Sanneen grim and grey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat musing in the twilight of</span>

				<span>"Great Saturn and the Moon are gone</span>

				<span class="i1">I, too, shall sink within the brine,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, too, shall sail above this peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And signal yonder groves of pine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behold the melancholy sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of this forgotten land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this side are the valleys bleak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this, the desert sand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>

			<p>
				<span>"O, think not of departing,</span>

				<span class="i1">Ah, too young I am to die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll find the magic wings; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still hangs a friendly sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let us above these pines, and clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scents awhile yet dwell;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where wouldst thou go, if thou wert now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sigh a last farewell?"</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou seest the busy elements</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dissolving one by one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The souls that are acquitted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the all-absorbing sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let's sing the song of darkness then;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy prison is the Whole;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What canst thou do, where wilt thou go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What wilt thou be, my Soul?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the air that weighs</span>

				<span>Thou wouldst not be the fog that chokes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The air in savage lust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the clouds that block</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The smoke's way to a star;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor linger in the guilty tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of clouds before the bar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the rain that taunts</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The all-devouring sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Itself destroying many a nest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In bush and rock and tree.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the thunder's tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spell-binding all the spheres;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor wouldst thou be the lightning blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That stabs and disappears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the dew that falls</span>

				<span class="i1">Set free from yonder clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to melt beneath the feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of surging human crowds."</span>
			</p>

			<p>
				<span>A sister to the dumb hydrangea thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mystery born of the Then and Now.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The color on thy clouded face—ah me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is't from the embers that still burn in thee?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Has not the forge of suffering robbed thee of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flame with which weak mortals feed their love?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wilt thou, no longer fancying the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjure a virgin flame from darkest night?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And feed it with the salvias of a soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That would, but yet—alas! she seeks the Whole.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hand that broke the screen, the heart that lied,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where are they? Come, the path of truth is wide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The silvery cataracts of roaring rills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meander in the shadows of the hills;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And their bass music,—does it not arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From that descent that leads up to the skies?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O how disarmed Desire uprises, how—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not the darkness crown the Lightning's brow?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet how I wish, yet how I shrink, when I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold thee—ah, she's ever in mine eye!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If thy pink, blue and golden hues disclose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The secret, might not that undo the rose?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou sister to the dumb hydrangea, when</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will all thy sombre musings rise again?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O, how the light drifts from the hemlock grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How in the night disarmed Desires do rove!</span>
