			<h2 epub:type="title">Ever to Be</h2>
			<p>
				<span>My far cry, though no one should echo,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though no one to listen should stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall dare with my burden the darkness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I shall not retreat from this land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I'm hurled 'neath the feet of the millions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who struggle their places to keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sea-nymphs still bathe with my Fancy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the Dryads still sweeten my sleep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though I'm crushed, cast away and forgotten,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I'm buried in the dust of their cars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can see through their madness above me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I can feel the quick pulse of the stars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though my head be the foot-stool of tyrants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though my back be a step to their throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I still dwell with the kings of Orion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I walk with the sun-queen alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though the fire of my youth should consume me,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though my body a brimstone should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can draw on the clouds for their water</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And behold! I've of water a sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though roofless, and friendless, and hopeless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loveless, and godless I stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waves of my Life shall continue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To murmur and laugh on the Strand.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Upon the Peak of Sanneen</h2>
			<p>
				<span>My soul and I, upon the peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Sanneen grim and grey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat musing in the twilight of</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A sombre summer day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"Great Saturn and the Moon are gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together o'er the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But will great Saturn e'er return</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should he elope with thee?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah well, who knows? when thou art gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, too, shall sink within the brine,—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, too, shall sail above this peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And signal yonder groves of pine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behold the melancholy sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of this forgotten land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this side are the valleys bleak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this, the desert sand."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"I hear the moaning of the wind,"</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My sad companion said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"The snow is gathering in me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the night is overhead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Long have we dwelt together, friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In our sweet ennui;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But were I now to take my leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas, what would I be?"</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"O, think not of departing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah, too young I am to die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I'll find the magic wings; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still hangs a friendly sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let us above these pines, and clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scents awhile yet dwell;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where wouldst thou go, if thou wert now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sigh a last farewell?"</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou seest the busy elements</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dissolving one by one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The souls that are acquitted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the all-absorbing sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let's sing the song of darkness then;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy prison is the Whole;—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What canst thou do, where wilt thou go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What wilt thou be, my Soul?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the air that weighs</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the rising dust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the fog that chokes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The air in savage lust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the clouds that block</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The smoke's way to a star;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor linger in the guilty tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of clouds before the bar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the rain that taunts</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The all-devouring sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Itself destroying many a nest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In bush and rock and tree.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the thunder's tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spell-binding all the spheres;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor wouldst thou be the lightning blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That stabs and disappears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the dew that falls</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alike on thorn and flower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor even the morning zephyr</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That blows o'er den and bower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou wouldst not be the virgin snow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Set free from yonder clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to melt beneath the feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of surging human crowds."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"No! none of these," my Soul replied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">"I'll shiver ever thrall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O let me rise, for I would be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sky above them all."</span>

			<p>
				<span>The cricket to the corn-crake came one day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shivering, yet buzzing in his wanton way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">And said: "I'm slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By hunger, brother, turn thou not from me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>'Tis winter, and I only beg of thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">A little grain."</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The corn-crake grinned and said in tone sublime:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"Where wert thou hidden in the harvest time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Thou dinning drone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why didst thou not come with us to the fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gather something for thy winter meals</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of what had grown?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>"O, I was entertaining with my rhymes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vineyards, and the fig trees, and the thymes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The summer long."</span>
				<br/>
				<span>"No then," replied the corn-crake, "not a seed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have I for such as thou; go home and feed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Upon thy Song."</span>
